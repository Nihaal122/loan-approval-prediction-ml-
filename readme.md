# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a **machine learning classification model** to predict whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details such as income, credit history, education, and property area.

The project uses the **Kaggle Loan Prediction dataset** and follows a complete **end-to-end ML workflow**, making it suitable for AI/ML and Data Science portfolios.
